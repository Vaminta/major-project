## TANK-OFF
### A cross-platform local multiplayer game made for my third year major project (CS39440)

This repository containing the game will not be updated and will remain a snapshot of the project at the time of completion (submission). For an up-to-date WIP repository, I will be uploading one soon which will contain fixes and improvements I have made since graduating.

Please refer to the original readme file within the "src" directory for instructions on running the game. The final project report is also available within the report directory.
