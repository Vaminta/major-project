# MMP Feedback
The feedback for the projects will be released about 9am on Thursday 23rd June 2022. There are two parts to your feedback: 
- The module mark, which is available on the Student Record
. This is released with the other marks for the Semester.
- This page will contain the text feedback from your Supervisor and Second Marker. A message will be sent to the module email list when the feedback is available here.

## Supervisor Feedback - Neal Snooke 

### Problem Analysis

A clear justification for not following the usual route of using a game engine was provided, why this approach is feasible and clear description of the type of game to be developed.

I would have expected to see a mention of some of the more significant elements of the solution such as the pathfinding algorithm for the computer guided objects in the analysis with a discussion of possible solution strategies/algorithms.


### Technical Work

Each iteration in the development was documented in detail together with testing and any issues arising. Comprehensive (non automated) testing.

The code is object oriented and appears well structured, although could do with a polish in a few places. The comment "A class that does stuff" is especially helpful...


### Evaluation

Good evaluation covering a number of aspects. More upfront consideration of key design choices such as the way time is handled in the game is important to avoid issues later on such as the difficulty implementing pause features.

The choice to not use an IDE and rely in a text editor will clearly have impacts when the project gets larger or significant changes are needed (eg refactoring). Possibly a false economy in the long run and I was pleased to see this acknowledged in the CE. Possibly the same for the lack of a version control system, however those tools are not the focus of these projects.


### Presentation

Overall a good report. I was finding it difficult to judge how well or what was actually done in some places. Perhaps more detail or screenshots or diagrams might have helped. Some white important aspects could have been discussed earlier int he report together with choices and alternatives perhaps.

Paragraphs should either be separated by a blank line or be indented to aid readability. Just using a carriage return is ambiguous and makes the test into large unstructured blocks.


### Demonstration

The demonstration showed a very playable two player game, with smooth graphics and well thought out puzzle solving interest. The game mechanics appeared to work well with objects interacting as they should and the computer controlled characters performing well.


### Initiative

Very Good. Greg took ownership of the project and drove it to a successful outcome.


### Summary
Overall a good project that successfully achieved its objectives. The choice not to use a game engine was slightly unusual these days but paid off within the constraints set for the project.

### Problem Analysis

While the narrative style works fairly well for a blog it's inappropriate for a report. Reports should present a factual style written in the third person. If you were to write a report in the personal narrative style it would be more appropriate to use the first person, I rather than passive voice. Style issues aside, the report is very good. It contains much of the relevant background information, focusing on the decision not to use game engines (a reasonable focus given the ubiquity of game engines these days). The description of the game engines, the pros and cons, and the reasoning behind not using them is extremely good and appropriate. Your description of the software development process is extremely good and you've clearly put a lot of thought into how you go about implementing your game, this shows in the final product which one download ran extremely well looked very polished and played smooth. In particular I was very impressed with your identification of risk areas, this is something that I rarely see in student projects and strikes me as a very good idea.


### Technical Work

I think your description of the implementation is very good. It's very easy to follow your design especially as you have appropriate diagrams throughout. You have clearly encountered multiple issues, many of which are covered up by modern game engines, and implemented appropriate solutions to these problems. An example of this is the joystick drift issue you identified. The implementation of what you called an entity system is very similar to the component systems elsewhere, a minor quibble would be that this should correctly have been called a component, but this is a relatively insignificant issue.


### Evaluation

The testing you performed as part of your project development is extremely good, the tests are appropriate, detailed and provide sufficient coverage of the game. However, it would be nice to see some user testing to get feedback on how well the game played, it's possible that you have some user testing performed but this did not stand out when reading your report.


### Presentation
The report is well presented throughout with many appropriate diagrams and illustrations.


### Demonstration
The demonstration went extremely well. On the day, the game was extremely smooth and easy to play. You were able to answer the technical questions extremely well and clearly understood the technical elements of the project.


### Summary

This is a deceptively simple project that actually contains numerous hidden difficulties based on the fact that it was implemented without a game engine. Both the implementation and the reports are to an extremely high standard and the resulting game is excellent to play.
